A mobile-first meditation app with a horror subversion twist. Initially presents as a calming meditation timer with peaceful aesthetics and forest sounds. After 10 seconds, the app begins to glitch at irregular intervals, transforming into a horror experience with threatening messages, red color schemes, and unsettling audio. The subversion creates an unexpected and unsettling user experience.
